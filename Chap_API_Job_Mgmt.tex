\chapter{Job Allocation Management}
\label{chap:api_job_mgmt}

Detecting stalled processes and receiving notification of external faults is, of course, only part of the problem. The application
must then work with the \ac{SMS} to actually do something about the situation. Typical current practice is to simply
terminate the impacted application, but future systems require less draconian solutions.

The \refapi{PMIx_Job_control_nb} \ac{API} enables the application and \ac{SMS} to coordinate the response to failures and other events.
This can include requesting termination of the entire job or a subset of processes within a job, but can
also be used in combination with other \ac{PMIx} capabilities (e.g., allocation support and event notification) for more nuanced responses. For example, an application notified of an incipient over-temperature condition on a node could use the \refapi{PMIx_Allocation_request_nb} interface to request replacement nodes while simultaneously using the \refapi{PMIx_Job_control_nb} interface to direct that a checkpoint event be delivered to all processes in the application. If replacement resources are not available, the application might use the \refapi{PMIx_Job_control_nb} interface to request that the job continue at a lower power setting, perhaps sufficient to avoid the over-temperature failure.

The job control API can also be used by an application to register itself as available for preemption when operating in an environment such as a cloud or where incentives, financial or otherwise, are provided to jobs willing to be preempted. Registration can include attributes indicating how many resources are being offered for preemption (e.g., all or only some portion), whether the application will require time to prepare for preemption, etc. Jobs that
request a warning will receive an event notifying them of an impending preemption (possibly including information as to the resources that will be taken away, how much time the application will be given prior to being preempted, whether the preemption will be a suspension or full termination, etc.) so they have an opportunity to save
their work. Once the application is ready, it calls the provided event completion callback function to indicate that
the SMS is free to suspend or terminate it, and can include directives regarding any desired restart.

Additional uses of the job control API continue to emerge. Recent additions include: (a) register temporary files and directories for cleanup upon termination of an individual process or the entire application to ensure complete cleanup even under abnormal termination conditions; (b) register a more generalized epilogue to be executed; (c) coordination of checkpoint execution; (d) passing of specified signals (kill, pause, resume, etc.) to specific processes or the entire application; and (e) request for provisioning of a specific image on one or more nodes.

\descr

Request an allocation operation from the host resource manager.
Several broad categories are envisioned, including the ability to:

\begin{compactitem}
%
\item Request allocation of additional resources, including memory, bandwidth, and compute.
This should be accomplished in a non-blocking manner so that the application can continue to progress while waiting for resources to become available.
Note that the new allocation will be disjoint from (i.e., not affiliated with) the allocation of the requestor - thus the termination of one allocation will not impact the other.
%
\item Extend the reservation on currently allocated resources, subject to scheduling availability and priorities.
This includes extending the time limit on current resources, and/or requesting additional resources be allocated to the requesting job.
Any additional allocated resources will be considered as part of the current allocation, and thus will be released at the same time.

Request a job control action.
The \refarg{targets} array identifies the processes to which the requested job control action is to be applied.
A \code{NULL} value can be used to indicate all processes in the caller's namespace.
The use of \refconst{PMIX_RANK_WILDARD} can also be used to indicate that all processes in the given namespace are to be included.

The directives are provided as \refstruct{pmix_info_t} structures in the \refarg{directives} array.
The callback function provides a \refarg{status} to indicate whether or not the request was granted, and to provide some information as to the reason for any denial in the \refapi{pmix_info_cbfunc_t} array of \refstruct{pmix_info_t} structures.
If non-\code{NULL}, then the specified \refarg{release_fn} must be called when the callback function completes - this will be used to release any provided \refstruct{pmix_info_t} array.

\section{Process and Job Monitoring}
\label{chap:api_job_mgmt:monitor}

In addition to external faults, a common problem encountered in \ac{HPC} applications is a failure to make
progress due to some internal conflict in the computation. These situations can
result in a significant waste of resources as the \ac{SMS} is unaware of the problem, and thus cannot terminate the
job. Various watchdog methods have been developed for detecting this situation, including requiring a periodic ``heartbeat''
from the application and monitoring a specified file for changes in size and/or modification time.

At the request of \ac{SMS} vendors and members, a monitoring support interface has been included in the PMIx v2 standard. The defined \ac{API} allows applications to request monitoring, directing what is to be monitored, the frequency of the associated check, whether or not the application is to be notified (via the event notification subsystem) of stall detection, and other characteristics of the operation. In addition, heartbeat and file monitoring methods have been included in the \ac{PRI} but are active only when requested.

\pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_MONITOR_FILE_DROPS}


%%%%
\descr

Request that application processes be monitored via several possible methods.
For example, that the server monitor this process for periodic heartbeats as an indication that the process has not become ``wedged''.
When a monitor detects the specified alarm condition, it will generate an event notification using the provided error code and passing along any available relevant information.
It is up to the caller to register a corresponding event handler.

The \refarg{monitor} argument is an attribute indicating the type of monitor being requested.
For example, \refattr{PMIX_MONITOR_FILE} to indicate that the requestor is asking that a file be monitored.

The \refarg{error} argument is the status code to be used when generating an event notification alerting that the monitor has been triggered.
The range of the notification defaults to \refconst{PMIX_RANGE_NAMESPACE}.
This can be changed by providing a \refconst{PMIX_RANGE} directive.

The \refarg{directives} argument characterizes the monitoring request (e.g., monitor file size) and frequency of checking to be done

The \refarg{cbfunc} function provides a \refarg{status} to indicate whether or not the request was granted, and to provide some information as to the reason for any denial in the \refapi{pmix_info_cbfunc_t} array of \refstruct{pmix_info_t} structures.
