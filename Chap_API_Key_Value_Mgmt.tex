\chapter{Key/Value Management}
\label{chap:api_kv_mgmt}

Management of key-value pairs in \ac{PMIx} is a distributed responsibility. While the stated objective of the \ac{PMIx} community is to eliminate collective operations, it is recognized that the traditional method of publishing/exchanging data must be supported until that objective can be met. This method relies on processes to discover and publish their local information which is collected by the local PMIx server library.
Global exchange of the published information is then executed via a collective operation performed by the host \ac{SMS} servers.

\end{arglist}

Returns \refconst{PMIX_SUCCESS} or a negative value corresponding to a PMIx error constant.

%%%%
\descr

Push a value into the client's namespace.
The client's \ac{PMIx} library will cache the information locally until \refapi{PMIx_Commit} is called.

The provided \refarg{scope} is passed to the local PMIx server, which will distribute the data to other processes according to the provided scope.
The \refstruct{pmix_scope_t} values are defined in \specrefstruct{pmix_scope_t}.
Specific implementations may support different scope values, but all implementations must support at least \code{PMIX_GLOBAL}.

The \refstruct{pmix_value_t} structure supports both string and binary values.
PMIx implementations will support heterogeneous environments by properly converting binary values between host architectures, and will copy the provided \refarg{value} into internal memory.

\adviceimplstart
The PMIx server library will properly pack/unpack data to accommodate heterogeneous environments. The host \ac{SMS} is not involved in this action. The \refarg{value} argument must be copied - the caller is free to release it following return from the function.
\adviceimplend

\adviceuserstart
The value is copied by the PMIx client library. Thus, the application is free to release and/or modify the value once the call to \refapi{PMIx_Put} has completed.

Note that keys starting with a string of ``\code{pmix}'' are exclusively reserved for the \ac{PMIx} standard and must not be used in calls to \refapi{PMIx_Put}. Thus, applications should never use a defined ``PMIX_'' attribute as the key in a call to \refapi{PMIx_Put}.

\adviceimplend

%%%%
\descr

Retrieve information for the specified \refarg{key} as published by the process identified in the given \refstruct{pmix_proc_t}, returning a pointer to the value in the given address.

This is a blocking operation - the caller will block until either the specified data becomes available from the specified rank in the \refarg{proc} structure or the operation times out should the \refattr{PMIX_TIMEOUT} attribute have been given.
The caller is responsible for freeing all memory associated with the returned \refarg{value} when no longer required.

The \refarg{info} array is used to pass user requests regarding the get operation.

\adviceuserstart
Information provided by the \ac{PMIx} server at time of process start is accessed by providing the namespace of the job with the rank set to \refconst{PMIX_RANK_WILDCARD}. The list of data referenced in this way is maintained on the \ac{PMIx} web site at \url{https://pmix.org/support/faq/wildcard-rank-access/} but includes items such as the number of processes in the namespace (\refattr{PMIX_JOB_SIZE}), total available slots in the allocation (\refattr{PMIX_UNIV_SIZE}), and the number of nodes in the allocation (\refattr{PMIX_NUM_NODES}).

Data posted by a process via \refapi{PMIx_Put} needs to be retrieved by specifying the rank of the posting process. All other information is retrievable using a rank of \refconst{PMIX_RANK_WILDCARD} when the information being retrieved refers to something non-rank specific (e.g., number of processes on a node, number of processes in a job), and using the rank of the relevant process when requesting information that is rank-specific (e.g., the \ac{URI} of the process, or the node upon which it is executing). Each subsection of Section \ref{api:struct:attributes} indicates the appropriate rank value for referencing the defined attribute.

This is an asynchronous operation.
The \ac{PRI} will immediately return to the caller while the data is transmitted to the local server in the background.

Publish the data in the \refarg{info} array for subsequent lookup.
By default, the data will be published into the \refconst{PMIX_SESSION} range and with \refconst{PMIX_PERSIST_APP} persistence.
Changes to those values, and any additional directives, can be included in the \refstruct{pmix_info_t} array. Attempts to access the data by processes outside of the provided data range will be rejected. The persistence parameter instructs the server as to how long the data is to be retained.

The blocking form will block until the server confirms that the data has been sent to the \ac{PMIx} server and that it has obtained confirmation from its host \ac{SMS} daemon that the data is ready to be looked up. Data is copied into the backing key-value data store, and therefore the \refarg{info} array can be released upon return from the blocking function call.

\adviceuserstart
Duplicate keys within the specified data range may lead to unexpected behavior depending
on host RM implementation of the backing key-value store.
\adviceuserend

\adviceimplstart
Implementations should, to the best of their ability, detect duplicate keys and protect the
user from unexpected behavior - preferably returning an error. This version of the
standard does not define a specific error code to be returned, so the implementation must
make it clear to the user what to expect in this scenario. One suggestion is to define an RM
specific error code beyond the \refconst{PMIX_EXTERNAL_ERR_BASE} boundary. Future versions of the standard
will clarify that a specific \ac{PMIx} error be returned when conflicting values are published for a given
key, and will provide attributes to allow modified behaviors such as overwrite.

Lookup information published by this or another process.
By default, the search will be conducted across the \refconst{PMIX_SESSION} range.
Changes to the range, and any additional directives, can be provided in the \refstruct{pmix_info_t} array.

Note that the search is also constrained to only data published by the current user (i.e., the search will not return data published by an application being executed by another user).
There currently is no option to override this behavior - such an option may become available later via an appropriate \refstruct{pmix_info_t} directive.

The \argref{data} parameter consists of an array of \refstruct{pmix_pdata_t} struct with the keys specifying the requested information.
Data will be returned for each key in the associated \refarg{value} struct.
Any key that cannot be found will return with a data type of \refconst{PMIX_UNDEF}.
The function will return \refconst{PMIX_SUCCESS} if \emph{any} values can be found, so the caller must check each data element to ensure it was returned.

The proc field in each \refstruct{pmix_pdata_t} struct will contain the namespace/rank of the process that published the data.

\adviceuserstart
Although this is a blocking function, it will \emph{not} wait by default for the requested data to be published.
Instead, it will block for the time required by the server to lookup its current data and return any found items.
Thus, the caller is responsible for ensuring that data is published prior to executing a lookup, using \refattr{PMIX_WAIT} to instruct the server to wait for the data to be published, or for retrying until the requested data is found.

Data for the provided NULL-terminated \refarg{keys} array will be returned in the provided callback function.
As with \refapi{PMIx_Lookup}, the default behavior is to \emph{not} wait for data to be published.
The \refarg{info} array can be used to modify the behavior as previously described by \refapi{PMIx_Lookup}. Both the \refarg{info} and \refarg{keys} arrays must be maintained until the callback is provided.

\reqattrstart
\ac{PMIx} libraries are not required to directly support any attributes for this function. However, any provided attributes must be passed to the host \ac{SMS} daemon for processing, and the \ac{PMIx} library is \textit{required} to add the \refPRIAttributeItem{PMIX_USERID} and the \refPRIAttributeItem{PMIX_GRPID} attributes of the client process that is requesting the operation.

\reqattrend

\optattrstart
The following attributes are optional for host environments that support this operation:

\pastePRRTEAttributeItem{PMIX_TIMEOUT}
\pastePRRTEAttributeItem{PMIX_RANGE}

\optattrend

\adviceimplstart
We recommend that implementation of the \refattr{PMIX_TIMEOUT} attribute be left to the host environment due to race condition considerations between completion of the operation versus internal timeout in the \ac{PMIx} server library. Implementers that choose to support \refattr{PMIX_TIMEOUT} directly in the \ac{PMIx} server library must take care to resolve the race condition and should avoid passing \refattr{PMIX_TIMEOUT} to the host environment so that multiple competing timeouts are not created.
\adviceimplend


%%%%
\descr

Unpublish data posted by this process using the given \refarg{keys}.
The function will block until the data has been removed by the server (i.e., it is safe to publish that key again).
A value of \code{NULL} for the \refarg{keys} parameter instructs the server to remove \emph{all} data published by this process.

By default, the range is assumed to be \refconst{PMIX_SESSION}.
Changes to the range, and any additional directives, can be provided in the \refarg{info} array.
