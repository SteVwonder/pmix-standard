\chapter{Security}
\label{chap:api_security}

Applications and tools often interact with each other in ways that require verification of the identity of the user making the request, and access to that user's relevant authorizations. This is particularly important when tools connect directly to a system-level \ac{PMIx} server that may be operating at a privileged level. A variety of system management software packages provide this service, but the lack of standardized interfaces makes portability problematic.

This section defines two \ac{PMIx} client-side \acp{API} for this purpose. These are most likely to be used by user-space applications/tools, but are not restricted to that realm.

\section{Obtaining Credentials}
\label{chap:api_security:obtain}

The \ac{API} for obtaining a credential is a non-blocking operation since the host environment may have to contact a remote credential service. The definition takes into account the potential that the returned credential could be sent via some mechanism to another application that resides in an environment using a different security mechanism. Thus, provision is made for the system to return additional information (e.g., the identity of the issuing agent) outside of the credential itself and visible to the application.

\argin{cbdata}{Data to be passed to the callback function (memory reference)}
\end{arglist}

Returns one of the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \refconst{PMIX_SUCCESS}, indicating that the request has been communicated to the local \ac{PMIx} server - result will be returned in the provided \refarg{cbfunc}
    \item a \ac{PMIx} error constant indicating either an error in the input or that the request is unsupported - the \refarg{cbfunc} will \textit{not} be called
\end{itemize}

\reqattrstart
\ac{PMIx} libraries that choose not to support this operation \textit{must} return \refconst{PMIX_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED} when the function is called. Implementations that support the operation may choose to internally execute integration for some security environments (e.g., directly contacting a \textit{munge} server) - there are no identified required attributes for this \ac{API}.

However, if the \ac{PMIx} implementation provides support for this \ac{API} and the request cannot be processed by the library itself, then any attributes that are provided by the client must be passed to the host environment for processing. In addition, the following attributes are required to be included in the \refarg{info} array passed from the \ac{PMIx} library to the host environment:

\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_USERID}
\pastePRIAttributeItem{PMIX_GRPID}

\optattrstart
The following attributes are optional for host environments that support this operation:

\pasteAttributeItem{PMIX_TIMEOUT}

\optattrend

\adviceimplstart
We recommend that implementation of the \refattr{PMIX_TIMEOUT} attribute be left to the host environment due to race condition considerations between completion of the operation versus internal timeout in the \ac{PMIx} server library. Implementers that choose to support \refattr{PMIX_TIMEOUT} directly in the \ac{PMIx} server library must take care to resolve the race condition and should avoid passing \refattr{PMIX_TIMEOUT} to the host environment so that multiple competing timeouts are not created.

\section{Validating Credentials}
\label{chap:api_security:validate}

The \ac{API} for validating a credential is a non-blocking operation since the host environment may have to contact a remote credential service. Provision is made for the system to return additional information regarding possible authorization limitations beyond simple authentication.
